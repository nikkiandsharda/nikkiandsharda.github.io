# What is Personal Health Information?
- We understand that medical appointments can be tricky to navigate. It is important to be aware of how your health information is taken by medical health professionals, and how your health information is stored.
- Understanding privacy rights and privacy policies can be complex. An alarming 23% of Canadians state that they have poor knowledge in knowing how to protect their privacy (Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, 2023).
- In Canada, doctors typically enter information about your health onto a computer (Government of Canada, 2024).

- Doctors keep personal information about your health, including but not limited to, information about test results, allergies, and prescriptions (Government of Canada, 2024).

# How is this information used?
- It is important to be aware of third parties who may access this information. Third parties are considered anybody who is not your healthcare provider or yourself.
- When in doubt, ask your healthcare provider who else may have access to your medical records.
- For example, the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) has attempted to access electronic medical records (Government of Canada, 2024).
- However, you can **opt out** of sharing your information with CPCSSN (Government of Canada, 2024). This means that you can choose to refuse to have your information be shared with CPCSSN.
- To opt out, you must inform your healthcare provider (Government of Canada, 2024).

# Why do other people other than my doctor and I have access to my information?
- Unfortunately, many organizations claim to use our data to improve their services to us. For example, the CPCSSN claims to collect patient information for research purposes (Government of Canada, 2024).
- Nonetheless, it is important to not feel pressured into having to share one's private and personal information with unknown parties.

# Are there privacy laws in Canada that will protect my health information?
- In short, there are laws that aim to protect privacy. However, they are not perfect. For this reason, it is recommended to stay mindful of the ways in which your health information is being used, and how you can protect your privacy. It is also important to keep in mind that laws may differ depending on the province you live in.

# *Canada's Privacy Act* (Government of Canada, 2021)
- This act is a federal law, which means it applies to all of Canada.
- It states that if you are a Canadian citizen, or if you are physically within Canada, you have the right to gain access to your personal information that is kept by a federal institution. However, it also states that this request may be denied if it is not beneficial for the individual to read the medical record.

## *Personal Health Information Protection Act* 
- Some important highlights from this act include:
- It claims that you have the right to withdraw your consent. Meaning, if you give permission for your information to be collected, you have the right to change your mind. However, your information is still allowed to be used *before* you withdrew your consent (Ontario, 2004).

- You have the right to file a complaint to the Information Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (IPC) about any potential breaches of privacy (Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, 2015)
- You can also file a complaint in the event that you are denied a correction request (Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, 2015). This means that if there are errors in your personal information and your request to fix it is denied, you can report it.
- Although Canada's Privacy Act states that in certain circumstances your request to view medical records may be denied, under the Personal Health Information Protection Act, you have the right to file a complaint if you are not given access to your personal health information (IPC, 2015).

# Why are Privacy laws not protective enough of my privacy?
- Unfortunately, privacy laws still have a long way to go to ensure that the privacy of every individual is adequately protected. As you can see from above, privacy laws are not perfect.
- Advocacy groups such as the Canadian Civil Liberties Association are hard at work in reforming privacy law (Canadian Civil Liberties Association, 2025).
