🔐 Create a Strong Password
✅ What to do:
1. Use at least 12 characters
– The longer your password, the better.
2. Mix it up
– Use uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols (like !, @, #).
3. Avoid personal info
– Don’t use your name, birthday, or anything easy to guess.
4. Make it unique
– Use a different password for each account. Don’t reuse the same one.
5. Try a passphrase
– Use a sentence or group of words you’ll remember, like:
MyDogLoves2Run! or CoffeeAt8AMisBest!
6. Use a password manager (optional)
– Apps like Bitwarden or 1Password can safely store and create strong passwords for you.
✅ Example of a strong password: B3tter!Life2025$
❌ Weak password example: 123456, password, Toronto2023
🔐 Why it matters: A strong password helps keep your personal information safe by making it harder for hackers to access your accounts.

🔐 Turn On Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
✅ What to do:
1. Log in to your account
– Open your banking app or website and sign in with your username and password.
2. Go to your account settings or security settings
– Look for a menu labeled “Settings,” “Security,” or “Privacy.”
3. Find the MFA or Two-Step Verification option
– It may be called “Multi-Factor Authentication,” “2-Step Verification,” or “Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).”
4. Choose your second step
– Most banks let you choose one of these:
  A code sent by text message (SMS)
  A code sent to your email
  A code from an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator)
  A fingerprint or face scan, if supported
5. Follow the setup instructions
– You might need to scan a barcode or enter a code to connect your phone.
6. Test it
– The system will usually ask you to try logging in again using your second step.

📲 Keep Your Apps and Device Updated
Updating your phone and apps is important for your safety. Updates often fix security problems that hackers could use to steal your information.
✅ What to do:
  Turn on automatic updates for your phone and banking apps.
  Update your phone's operating system (iOS or Android) when you get a notification.
  Update security software like antivirus apps if you use them.
🔐 Why it matters:
  Updates help protect your personal and financial information from new online threats.

👀 Monitor Your Accounts Regularly
It’s a good habit to check your bank account often—even if you don’t think anything is wrong.
✅ What to do:
  Log in regularly to your banking app or online account.
  Look at your recent transactions and monthly statements.
  Watch for anything that seems wrong or unfamiliar—like charges you didn’t make.
🚨 If you see something suspicious:
  Contact your bank right away.
  Most banks in Canada offer fraud protection and can help you fix the issue.
🔐 Why it matters:
  Checking your account helps you catch fraud early and protect your money.
