# 🔐 **Create a Strong Password**

✅ What to do:
- Use at least 12 characters
– The longer your password, the better.
- Mix it up
– Use uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols (like !, @, #).
- Avoid personal info
– Don’t use your name, birthday, or anything easy to guess.
- Make it unique
– Use a different password for each account. Don’t reuse the same one.
- Try a passphrase
– Use a sentence or group of words you’ll remember, like:
MyDogLoves2Run! or CoffeeAt8AMisBest!
- Use a password manager (optional)
– Apps like Bitwarden or 1Password can safely store and create strong passwords for you.

✅ Example of a strong password: B3tter!Life2025$

❌ Weak password example: 123456, password, Toronto2023

🔐 Why it matters: A strong password helps keep your personal information safe by making it harder for hackers to access your accounts.

# 🔐 **Turn On Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

✅ What to do:
- Log in to your account
– Open your banking app or website and sign in with your username and password.
- Go to your account settings or security settings
– Look for a menu labeled “Settings,” “Security,” or “Privacy.”
- Find the MFA or Two-Step Verification option
– It may be called “Multi-Factor Authentication,” “2-Step Verification,” or “Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).”
- Choose your second step
– Most banks let you choose one of these:
  A code sent by text message (SMS)
  A code sent to your email
  A code from an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator)
  A fingerprint or face scan, if supported
- Follow the setup instructions
– You might need to scan a barcode or enter a code to connect your phone.
- Test it
– The system will usually ask you to try logging in again using your second step.

# 📲 **Keep Your Apps and Device Updated**

Updating your phone and apps is important for your safety. Updates often fix security problems that hackers could use to steal your information.

✅ Here’s what to do:
- Turn on automatic updates for your phone and banking apps.
- Update your phone's operating system (iOS or Android) when you get a notification.
- Update security software like antivirus apps if you use them.

🛡️ Why it matters:
- Updates help protect your personal and financial information from new online threats.

# 👀 **Monitor Your Accounts Regularly**

It’s a good habit to check your bank account often—even if you don’t think anything is wrong.

✅ What to do:
- Log in regularly to your banking app or online account.
- Look at your recent transactions and monthly statements.
- Watch for anything that seems wrong or unfamiliar—like charges you didn’t make.

🚨 If you see something suspicious:
- Contact your bank right away.
- Most banks in Canada offer fraud protection and can help you fix the issue.

🔐 Why it matters:
- Checking your account helps you catch fraud early and protect your money.

# 📧 **Don’t Open Suspicious Emails or Links**
  
  Scammers often send fake emails or messages that promise money, gift cards, or prizes to trick you.

🚫 What NOT to do:
- Don’t click on links or download attachments from unknown senders.
- Don’t give out personal or banking information in response to a message.
- Be careful—even if the message looks real. Scammers can copy real logos and names.

✅ What to do instead:
- Delete the message if it looks suspicious.
- If you're not sure, contact the company directly using their official website or phone number.
- Report scam emails to report@spam.gc.ca (Canada’s spam reporting service).

🔒 Why it matters:
- These scams are designed to steal your money or personal information.

# 🔒 Secure Your Device with a PIN, Fingerprint, or Face ID

  Protect your phone or tablet so that no one else can open it—even if it gets lost or stolen.

✅ What to do:
- Set a strong, unique PIN (not 1234 or your birth year).
- Use biometric security if your device supports it:
- Fingerprint scanner
- Facial recognition (Face ID)
- Don’t share your PIN or unlock code with others.

🔐 Why it matters:
- This helps keep your banking apps and personal information safe, even if someone else gets your device.
