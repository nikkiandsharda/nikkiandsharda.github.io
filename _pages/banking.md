🔐 Create a Strong Password
1. Use at least 12 characters
– The longer your password, the better.
2. Mix it up
– Use uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols (like !, @, #).
3. Avoid personal info
– Don’t use your name, birthday, or anything easy to guess.
4. Make it unique
– Use a different password for each account. Don’t reuse the same one.
5. Try a passphrase
– Use a sentence or group of words you’ll remember, like:
MyDogLoves2Run! or CoffeeAt8AMisBest!
6. Use a password manager (optional)
– Apps like Bitwarden or 1Password can safely store and create strong passwords for you.
✅ Example of a strong password: B3tter!Life2025$
❌ Weak password example: 123456, password, Toronto2023
🔐 Why it matters: A strong password helps keep your personal information safe by making it harder for hackers to access your accounts.

🔐 How to Turn On Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
1. Log in to your account
– Open your banking app or website and sign in with your username and password.
2. Go to your account settings or security settings
– Look for a menu labeled “Settings,” “Security,” or “Privacy.”
3. Find the MFA or Two-Step Verification option
– It may be called “Multi-Factor Authentication,” “2-Step Verification,” or “Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).”
4. Choose your second step
– Most banks let you choose one of these:
  A code sent by text message (SMS)
  A code sent to your email
  A code from an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator)
  A fingerprint or face scan, if supported
5. Follow the setup instructions
– You might need to scan a barcode or enter a code to connect your phone.
6. Test it
– The system will usually ask you to try logging in again using your second step.
