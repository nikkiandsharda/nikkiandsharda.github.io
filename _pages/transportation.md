# Why should I be concerned about protecting my privacy?
- Whilst engaging in transportation, it is important to be aware of how privacy may be violated.
- This is particularly important when using apps such as Google maps, and also during travel.
- Being aware of how to protect privacy whilst traveling is extremely important, especially as immigrants may be looking to navigate how to get to new and unfamiliar places, and traveling to and from their home countries.

# How can Google Maps violate my privacy?
- Apps such as Google maps have faced controversies in the past for violating privacy. For example, street view on Google maps has garnered some controversy, cars parked outside may have had their license plates identified and collected by Google (Binder, 2024)
- Google is known for tracking its users, such as tracking user locaton (Hansen, 2025).
- It is recommended to turn off Cookies to avoid being tracked (Hansen, 2025).

# What are cookies?
- Cookies are in our electric devices.
- Cookies collects information from us, and track what we do online (Browne, 2024)

# How do I turn cookies off? (Google, 2025)
- Turn on your phone.
- Open the Google Chrome app.
- Click **Settings**.
- Then, click **Site Settings > Third Party Cookies**
- Click **Block third-party cookies**

# Why am I being tracked in the first place?
- Apps and platforms such as Google engage in tracking to create a profile of you and your interests so they can advertise better products to you in the hopes that you will spend money on them (Hansen, 2025).
- Surveillance is commonly used to generate profit.

# How can I protect my privacy while traveling abroad?
- According to the *Canada's Privacy Act* which applies to all Canadian citizens, and those who are physically within Canada, the law is relevant when individuals either exit or enter Canada.
- Note: your cybersecurity is at risk while traveling. It is important to be mindful when connecting to wifi networks in unfamiliar spaces, as hackers are more likely to steal information in these spaces (Government of Canada, 2024).
- Turn your wifi off to avoid getting automatically connected to unfamiliar wifi networks (Goverment of Canada, 2024). Alternatively, you can also set your phone so that it does not automatically connect to unknown wifi networks.
- Always remember to log out of any accounts, especially when using publicly available computers (Government of Canada, 2024).
- Be cautious when using bluetooth devices, such as pairing your phone with bluetooth enabled cars (Government of Canada, 2024). This is ultimately your choice, but be aware that the data from your phone that contains your personal information may get transferred to the car's system (Government of Canada, 2024). This could happen whilst connecting your phone's GPS system to the car's bluetooth system.
