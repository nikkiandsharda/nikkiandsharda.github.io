Here are some simple tips to help you stay safe while using social media in Canada.

# 🔐 **Adjust Your Account to “Private”**
Setting your social media account to private helps control who can see what you share.

✅ What to do:
- Go to your privacy settings on apps like Instagram, Facebook, or TikTok.
- Set your profile to “Private” or limit it so that only friends or followers you approve can:
    - See your posts and photos
    - Send you messages
    - Tag you in content

🔒 Why it matters:
- This helps protect your personal life and information from strangers or scammers.

# 🙈 **Limit the Personal Information You Share**
Be careful about what you post online—some details should stay private.

🚫 What to avoid posting:
- Your full birthdate
- Your home address
- Your phone number
- Your real-time location (like "at the airport now!")

✅ What to do:
- Keep personal info off your profile and posts.
- Share only with people you trust.
- Turn off location tagging on your photos and posts.

🔐 Why it matters:
- Sharing too much can make it easier for scammers to steal your identity or target you.
