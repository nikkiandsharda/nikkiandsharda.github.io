Here are some simple tips to help you stay safe while using social media in Canada.

# 🔐 **Adjust Your Account to “Private”**
Setting your social media account to private helps control who can see what you share.

✅ What to do:
- Go to your privacy settings on apps like Instagram, Facebook, or TikTok.
- Set your profile to “Private” or limit it so that only friends or followers you approve can:
    - See your posts and photos
    - Send you messages
    - Tag you in content

🔒 Why it matters:
- This helps protect your personal life and information from strangers or scammers.

# 🙈 **Limit the Personal Information You Share**
Be careful about what you post online—some details should stay private.

🚫 What to avoid posting:
- Your full birthdate
- Your home address
- Your phone number
- Your real-time location (like "at the airport now!")

✅ What to do:
- Keep personal info off your profile and posts.
- Share only with people you trust.
- Turn off location tagging on your photos and posts.

🔐 Why it matters:
- Sharing too much can make it easier for scammers to steal your identity or target you.

# 🔐 **Create a Strong Password**

✅ What to do:
- Use at least 12 characters
– The longer your password, the better.
- Mix it up
– Use uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols (like !, @, #).
- Avoid personal info
– Don’t use your name, birthday, or anything easy to guess.
- Make it unique
– Use a different password for each account. Don’t reuse the same one.
- Try a passphrase
– Use a sentence or group of words you’ll remember, like:
MyDogLoves2Run! or CoffeeAt8AMisBest!
- Use a password manager (optional)
– Apps like Bitwarden or 1Password can safely store and create strong passwords for you.

✅ Example of a strong password: B3tter!Life2025$

❌ Weak password example: 123456, password, Toronto2023

🔐 Why it matters: A strong password helps keep your personal information safe by making it harder for hackers to access your accounts.

# 🔐 **Turn On Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

✅ What to do:
- Log in to your account
– Open your banking app or website and sign in with your username and password.
- Go to your account settings or security settings
– Look for a menu labeled “Settings,” “Security,” or “Privacy.”
- Find the MFA or Two-Step Verification option
– It may be called “Multi-Factor Authentication,” “2-Step Verification,” or “Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).”
- Choose your second step
– Most banks let you choose one of these:
  A code sent by text message (SMS)
  A code sent to your email
  A code from an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator)
  A fingerprint or face scan, if supported
- Follow the setup instructions
– You might need to scan a barcode or enter a code to connect your phone.
- Test it
– The system will usually ask you to try logging in again using your second step.

# ⚠️ **Don’t Open Suspicious Links from Unknown Senders**
Scammers sometimes send fake messages or links through social media to trick you.

🚫 What to avoid:
- Messages from people you don’t know that say things like “Look what I found!” or “You won a prize!”
- Clicking on links that look strange or don’t match the sender’s usual style.

✅ What to do:
- Ignore or delete the message.
- Block or report the sender if it seems unsafe.
- If a friend sends a weird link, ask them first—they might have been hacked.

🔐 Why it matters:
- These links can steal your personal info or install harmful software on your device.

# 🎮 **Be Careful with Quizzes and Games on Social Media**
Some fun-looking quizzes or games (like “What’s your celebrity match?”) might ask for access to your profile, photos, or friend list.

🚫 What to avoid:
- Clicking on third-party apps or games that ask for permission to see your profile info.
- Giving access to apps you don’t fully trust or recognize.

✅ What to do:
- Skip games or quizzes that ask for too much personal info.
- Check your app settings and remove apps you no longer use or trust.

🔐 Why it matters:
- Some of these apps are designed to collect your personal data and share it without your permission.

(Government of Canada, 2022)

# 🧹 Review Old Posts and Clean Up Your Profile
It’s a good idea to go back and check what you’ve shared in the past—you might find things that reveal too much personal information.

✅ What to do:
- Look through your older posts, photos, and comments.
- Delete or hide anything that includes:
- Personal details (like your phone number or address)
- Sensitive topics
- Embarrassing or private content you no longer want public
- On some platforms, you can limit old posts to be seen by “friends only.”

🔐 Why it matters:
- Cleaning up your digital footprint helps you stay safe and protect your privacy—especially if you're job hunting or meeting new people online.

(Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, 2019)

# 📍 Turn Off Location Tagging – Protect Where You Go
Sharing your location on social media might seem fun, but it can also reveal where you live, work, or visit often.

🚫 What to avoid:
- Tagging your location in posts or stories, especially places you go regularly (like home, school, work, or your child’s daycare).
- Posting photos with visible landmarks or street signs in the background that show where you are.

✅ What to do:
- Turn off location services for social media apps in your phone settings.
- Avoid tagging your exact location in real time.
- If you want to share, wait until after you’ve left the place.

🔐 Why it matters:
- Keeping your location private helps protect you from stalking, theft, or unwanted attention.
